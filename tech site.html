      <h3>1.QUALCOM INTRODUCE THEIR NEXT BIG THING </h3>
      <P>QUALCOM INTRODUCED THEIR FLAGSHIP CHIPSET SNAPDRAGON 8GEN 3.We have our very first Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered smartphone in for review, and we are eager to show you the performance jump the new hardware platform offers. While we cannot talk specifics about this particular smartphone just yet, nobody stops us from going through the benchmark scores it can output.</P>
      <hr />
      <p>We start with the CPU-intensive Geekbench test. As per Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 should be 30% faster than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. We weren't able to reach Qualcomm's official numbers, unfortunately.

        The jump in performance that we observed was nevertheless a healthy 25% in multi-core. The single core performance difference was less than stellar at about 11%.</p>
        <hr />
      <p>
        Next, GPU tests. Here, Qualcomm claims the new Adreno 750 GPU is 25% faster than the Adreno 740 inside the SD 8 Gen 2. Plus, it is also more power-efficient and should offer 40% better raytracing.
        
        In our offscreen testing, the new GPU was 16% better than the one in the non-overclocked SD 8 Gen 2 in the 1440p OpenGL ES 3.1 test, 13% better in the Vulkan test, and almost 22% better in the 1080p OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics benchmark.</p>

    <H3>2.OPENAI acheives record $1.6Bn in annualised revenue:Report</H3>
    <p>OpenAI, the Sam Altman helmed artificial intelligence (AI) research lab, has reported a record annualised revenue figure exceeding $1.6Bn, showcasing a remarkable 20% growth over just two months. These latest numbers, coming in via The Information, come on the heels of a leadership crisis that unfolded in November, when CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired and subsequently reinstated. Despite this turmoil, OpenAI has demonstrated resilience, retaining its business momentum and successfully selling AI technology to enterprises.</p>
    <p>The impressive revenue surge is primarily attributed to the widespread popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT product, an advanced conversational AI model that took the world by storm at its launch last year. ChatGPT single-handedly accelerated conversational AI technology to unprecedented levels, bringing AI to the forefront for several enterprises across the tech and IT domain.</p>

   </div>
   <p>The recent revenue accomplishment propels OpenAI’s valuation to $86 billion, as private investors recognise the potential of its cutting-edge AI technologies. Discussions about a new funding round are underway, with OpenAI aiming for a valuation of $100 billion or more. Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, plays a crucial role in the company’s financial structure.</p> 
   <p>However, alongside its financial triumphs, OpenAI has found itself entangled in legal disputes. The New York Times recently filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging copyright infringement. The media giant claims that its content was used to train AI models without proper authorisation, seeking damages in the billions of dollars.
   <p> In response to these legal challenges, OpenAI has sought partnerships with news outlets such as The Associated Press and Axel Springer to licence their content for AI model training. This move is an attempt to address concerns about the ethical use of media content in AI development.</p>

      <h3>3.FACEBOOK CEO SAYS PROBLEMS WILL TAKE YEARS TO FIX:REPORTS</h3>
      <p>San Francisco: Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, criticized for months by lawmakers, privacy advocates and some investors, said he was “proud of the progress we’ve made," fighting misinformation and protecting users’ personal data during one of the company’s most tumultuous years.</p>
      <p>“To be clear, addressing these issues is more than a one-year challenge," Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. “For some of these issues, like election interference or harmful speech, the problems can never fully be solved."This year was one of constant apologies for the social network, after multiple instances of broken trust with its users. Zuckerberg testified for the first time in front of Congress in April, explaining why Facebook allowed users’ data to fall into the hands of unauthorized third parties. In his reflection on Friday, he made the case that Facebook is now a changed company, and will be more proactive about problems.</p>
